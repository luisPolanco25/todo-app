# TodoApp

## Overview

This is the second TodoApp I created. This one is made with react and the command `$npx create-react-app`. In this app I used a custom hook called `useForm`, which was used to reset the values written on the app's input after someone press enter or clicks on `Add` button.

This app saves changes in local storage everytime todos are added or deleted, this is achieved thanks to `useEffect`.
